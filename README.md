# Hotline
And attempt to ressurect Hotline for modern Apple systems (iOS, macOS, etc) by completely rebuilding it in Swift and SwiftUI.

**Note:** This project so far does not server software. It is a client for connecting to and participating in Hotline servers. If you would like to host your own Hotline server (you should!), please checkout the very capable Mobius project: https://github.com/jhalter/mobius

# Goals
- Build a Hotline client for modern Apple systems.
- Keep the HotlineProtocol, HotlineClient, HotlineTrackerClient, and HotlineFileClient Swift code reusable so people can use it in other Swift Hotline projects.
- Bring a modern Hotline client to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS using one codebase.
- Ressurect the Hotline brand that has been expunged from trademark databases for over a decade. Hey, I want Hotline proper with the classic big red H and all on my modern Apple devices, okay? ;)
- Document the Hotline protocol.
- Have fun. :)
