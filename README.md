# Goals
- Keep the HotlineClient, HotlineTrackerClient, and HotlineFileClient classes reusable so people can use it in other Swift Hotline projects.
- Bring a modern Hotline client to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS using one codebase.
- Bring back some of that Hotline branding as the trademark on the name and logo have been expunged for years, hey, I want Hotline called Hotline with the classic H logo on my modern Apple device, okay? :)
- Have fun. :)
